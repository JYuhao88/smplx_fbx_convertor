1. WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS PACKAGE?
---------------------------------------

The FBX Python Bindings allow developers to write the FBX Python SDK using
their desired Python interpreter and Riverbank's Sip. Autodesk provides a
pre-compiled version of the FBX Python SDK but only for a specific version
of the Python interpreter (see the FBX Python SDK package)


2. PRE-REQUISITES
------------------------------

To be able to compile the sources in this package, you must also install the
FBX SDK.

A C++ compiler for your operating system will be required. For instance,
on Microsoft Windows, the PythonBinding.py script will assume that you are
working with Microsoft VisualStudio.

Finally, the Python interpreter must be available on the build machine.


3. HOW-TO
-------------
     
3.1  Download the latest version of the FBX SDK and install it.

3.2  Define the FBXSDK_ROOT environment variable to the location of the
     installed FBX SDK from step 3.1
     (example: set FBXSDK_ROOT=C:\Program Files\Autodesk\FBX\FBX SDK\2019.5)

3.3  On Windows only, define FBXSDK_COMPILER to specify version of the SDK to be used
     (example: set FBXSDK_COMPILER=vs2019)

4. BUILDING AND INSTALLING
--------------------------
    Install Sip version 6.6.2 (newer version have template issue)
        python -m pip install --force-reinstall -v "sip==6.6.2"
    Build and Install command:
        python -m pip install .
    Build only command:  
        python -m sipbuild.tools.build --verbose
    See Sip docmentation for more details: https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/static/Docs/sip/index.html#
